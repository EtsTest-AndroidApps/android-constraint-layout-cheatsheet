## :bookmark: Official Demo
Google has official demo project that contains a list of layouts that showcases the various features and usage of
[ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/ConstraintLayout.html) and 
[MotionLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/motion/MotionLayout)

See https://github.com/android/views-widgets-samples/tree/master/ConstraintLayoutExamples

## Proposed App Features
* Have a grid containing different feature set of `ConstraintLayout`
* For each feature, have different examples
* Each example should allow you to share the code snippet or copy to clipboard
* Each example may also contain additional resource links to blog or technical articles
* Example may have set of sliders/toggle to change metrics dynamically to visualize.

See **[contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md)** guideline if you want to add demos or fix something.

## Objective
These are the **my** objectives for this demo application.
* To explore all the features of constraint layout
* Learn and use material design component in the sample app
* Learn and use the new architecture components in the sample app
* Learn and use proper architecture for the app - likely MVVM
* Document everything well so that future external contribution is easier
